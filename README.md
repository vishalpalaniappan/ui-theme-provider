# ui-theme-provider
This react library provides themes which can be consumed by other components.

## Background
While working on the UI Layout Manager and component library, the need for a consistent theming system across all components became evident. To address this, I created this library to centralize and unify themes for reuse throughout all applications.

Themes are defined in a Figma design document and then imported into the library, making them easily accessible to any consumer. There are ways to export themes defined in a figma document and import them into this provider, I haven't explored it as much as I want to yet but I will do that as this library is defined further.

In addition to color schemes, this library will also formalize the typography used across our UIs to ensure visual consistency and maintainability.

More to come.
