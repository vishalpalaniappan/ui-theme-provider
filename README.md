# ui-theme-provider
This react library provides themes which can be consumed by other components.

## Background
As I was working on the ui-layout-manager and component library, I needed a way to set the themes across all the components. This library was created as a way to unify themes across all our components. The themes will be defined in a figma design document, then imported into the library and exposed to whoever consumes this library. 

In addition to the color scheme, I am also planning on formalizing the typography used in our UI's using this library.

More to come.
